Back in 2012, I was introduced to uncertainty quantification. That was the period I came across various dense literature on the topic and summarised some of the papers in the form of a PowerPoint.

This git repo holds the pdf I prepared at that time. Itâ€™s still relevant and covers the basics of uncertainty modelling and introduction to stochastic finite element methods (FEM).
